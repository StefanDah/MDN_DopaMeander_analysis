## Data

The data in this project consists of neuronal activity of descending and dopaminergic neurons and walking and/or flying activity. Neuronal activity was recorded in-vivo in tethered adult Drosophila suspended on a spherical treadmill or during flight. 

## Repo structure

-- Still under construction-
